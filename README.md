Facial Recognition 
Using Open CV Libraries, we can access the Haarcascades Library for facial recognition for facial mapping (eyes, front of face, upperbody, and mouth/smile) in order to determine if someone is wearing a mask during this time as a public safety health measure.
I started with simple face recognition using CVLib which can detect faces and create bounding boxes. 
I then moved on to faces with masks vs. without in static photos.
I also made a fairly simple program using my webcam to determine mask wearing.
